Hello and welcome to my GitHub :)
Here, I explore ideas and projects I find interesting, mostly around data visualization, machine learning, and data analysis. With a strong background in theoretical physics, I’m comfortable working with complex data and programming, but I’m still eager to push myself further and learn new things.
You can check out my projects on [my website](https://altheacappelli.github.io/), and contact me by email at tea.cappelli@gmail.com
